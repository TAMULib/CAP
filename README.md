# CAP

CAP is the Curator's Administration Platform developed and maintained by [Texas A&M University Libraries](http://library.tamu.edu). 

CAP is an open source application that has been designed to provide a common user interface (UI) and application programing interface (API) for any Institutional Repository (IR) participating with a Digital Asset Management Ecosystem (DAME.)

Currently CAP has support for Fedora 4x through use of the Fedora Java Client. Future work will add support for Fedora 5x, and there has been some preliminary work to support DSpace 6x.

### User Documentation

CAP boasts an intuitive user interface, but some much needed user documentation is currently a work in progress.
