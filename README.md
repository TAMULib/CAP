# Curator's Administration Platform

*Curator's Administration Platform (CAP)*, consisting of a service back-end and a client front-end, is developed and maintained by [Texas A&M University Libraries][tamu-library].

*CAP* is an open source application that has been designed to provide a common user interface (UI) and application programing interface (API) for any *Institutional Repository (IR)* participating within a *Digital Asset Management Ecosystem (DAME)*.

Currently *CAP* has support for **Fedora 4x** through use of the [fcrepo-java-client][fcrepo_java_client-url].
Future work will add support for **Fedora 5x**, and there has been some preliminary work to support **DSpace 6x**.

For more technical users, deployment related configurations are described in the [Deployment Guide][deployment-guide].

## Deployment

A quick and easy deployment method using `docker-compose` is described in the [Deployment Guide][deployment-guide].

For _advanced use cases_, or when `docker-compose` is unavailable, the use of `docker` or `npm`/`mvn` is also described in the [Deployment Guide][deployment-guide].

Deployment, in general, may look something like this:

```shell
cp example.env .env
cp example.env.client .env.client
cp example.env.service .env.service

# Make any changes to the .env, .env.client, and .env.service files before here.
docker-compose up
```

<sub>_* Note: It may be necessary to disable caching during build by passing `--no-cache` to the `docker-compose up` command._</sub>
