# CAP

CAP is the Curator's Administration Platform developed and maintained by [Texas A&M University Libraries](http://library.tamu.edu).

CAP is an open source application that has been designed to provide a common user interface (UI) and application programing interface (API) for any Institutional Repository (IR) participating within a Digital Asset Management Ecosystem (DAME.)

Currently CAP has support for Fedora 4x through use of the [fcrepo-java-client](https://github.com/fcrepo4-exts/fcrepo-java-client). Future work will add support for Fedora 5x, and there has been some preliminary work to support DSpace 6x.
